Notifications
This page will use a Factory-type pattern to create the notification system for this calendar.
Through this system, the user will be able to:

1. Receive notifications at a specified time prior to each event
2. Select the type of notification received (email, text, etc.)
3. Select sound made when notification is given

Notification settings will be rendered in the preferences page and possibly on each event
